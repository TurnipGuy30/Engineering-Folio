# PMI
## Draft 1
### P
- Support for tensile forces (bottom left)
- Beam under arm for compressive forces
- Specifically designed to combat the weight; lots of triangles
### M
- Uses lots of material, therefore heavy
- Intricate to build; would take too long
### I
- Net structure
## Draft 2
### P
- Unusual shape
- Support on both sides
- Base is far from end of arm
### M
- Arm is unsupported; needs a beam
- Needs more counterweight
### I
- Intertwining shape
- Diagonal tower
## Draft 3
### P
- I mean, it's a swing set...
### M
- Not much room for engineering principles
- Needs a net structure
- Long stretch of no support (between A-frames)
### I
- Doesn't look like a crane; more room for creativity
