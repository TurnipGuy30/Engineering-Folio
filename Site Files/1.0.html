  <h1>Part A - 1.0</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h3>Important Design Criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The structure must be able to lift a weight of 1kg to a height of 800mm in 60 seconds, at no closer than 400mm to the base.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Critical Design Factors:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Height</li>
      <li>Width</li>
      <li>Weight-bearing properties</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Design Constraints:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Any “lifting structure” can be used as a starting point for designs.</li>
      <li>5mm^2 timber will be provided for the build, and no other materials can be used.</li>
      <li>Hot glue can be used, but only to fuse joints.</li>
      <li>A LEGO Technics Kit will serve as a powered winch to demonstrate workability.</li>
      <li>A point system will be awarded for the overall weight of the lifting structure.</li>
    </ul>
