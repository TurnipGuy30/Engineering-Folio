    <h3>Construction process</h3>
    <p>Currently, the group is mostly using the scroll saw to cut pieces for the tall pillar that make up the height of the structure. These pieces are then fused with the hot glue gun to form the supporting net. Besides always maintaning workshop safety, the only focus as of now is accuracy in measuring the wood. I have found it easy to measure a length, then use it as a reference to measure and cut three sticks at once.</p>
