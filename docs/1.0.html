  <h1>1.0 - Part A</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <h3>Important Design Criteria:</h3>
    <p>The struture must make use of the engineering principles, using triangles to account for both compressive and tensile forces.</p>
    <h3>Critical Design Factors:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The structures height needs to be sufficient to lift the weight to the appropriate height.</li>
      <li>It must fit onto the 300x300mm base.</li>
      <li>It must have the weight-bearing properties needed to lift the weight without breaking.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Design Constraints:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The structure must be able to lift a weight of 1kg to a height of 800mm in 60 seconds, at no closer than 400mm to the base.</li>
      <li>Any “lifting structure” can be used as a starting point for designs. This means it could look like a crane, seesaw, or even a trebuchet.</li>
      <li>5mm<sup>2</sup> timber will be provided for the build, and no other materials can be used.</li>
      <li>Hot glue can be used, but only to fuse joints.</li>
      <li>A <em>LEGO Technics Kit</em> will serve as a powered winch to demonstrate workability.</li>
      <li>A point system will be awarded for the overall weight of the structure, and the maximum weight it can lift without failing.</li>
    </ul>
